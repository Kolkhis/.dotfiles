# Neovim Config Files

These are my personal nvim config files.

Feel free to take anything you like out of this and add it to your own config!

I use this config on Windows, WSL (Ubuntu), as well as Termux on my Galaxy S22 (yes, it works).


### Plugins

For a list of my plugins, see [packer.lua](https://github.com/Kolkhis/main-nvim-config/blob/main/lua/kolkhis/packer.lua)


### Credit

I've taken inspiration from various configs around GitHub. Mostly hotkeys, and some functions.
The most notable sources:

* [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
* [ThePrimagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)
