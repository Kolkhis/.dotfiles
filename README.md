# Dotfiles


These are the dotfiles for my homelab VM running Ubuntu Server.  


Hopefully I'll be able to get a headless server to use instead of a VM soon. When that happens,
this repo will have the dotfiles from there.


If you're looking for my nvimrc, it's here, but it also has its own separate repo. That's [here](https://github.com/Kolkhis/main-nvim-config).


This is my first time setting up configuration files for a linux machine, but even so, if you find
something you like, use it!


Currently trying out Stow for my first-time dotfile management. I like it so far.
