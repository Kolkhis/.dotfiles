# Package List for Ubuntu Server Workstation

* stow
* gcc
* unzip
* tree
* w3m
* lolcat
* lynx
* golang
* python3.10-venv
* nvim ( sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y )
* tmux
* screen
* cargo (rust) - `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
* tldr
* fzf
* parallel <- Check this out. It's apparently sick.

... probably more that I can't think of right now. Is there a better way to get a list of packages
that were *explicitly* installed by the user with `Advanced Packaging Tool` (apt)?
