"""One elf loaded all the rucksacks for Jungle Journey. He screwed up. He didn't follow packing
instructions, things need to be rearranged.

Each rucksack has two large compartments.
All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments.

Elves made a list of items currently in each rucksack (puzzle input).

Item types identified by a single lowercases or uppercase letter 
(`A` and `a` are different items)

One line = One rucksack contents
First half of line  = compartment 1
Second half of line = compartment 2
