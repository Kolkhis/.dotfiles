NAME
       w3m - a text based web browser and pager

SYNOPSIS
       w3m [OPTION]... [ file | URL ]...

DESCRIPTION
       w3m  is  a  text  based  browser which can display local or remote web pages as well as other documents.  It is able to process HTML tables and frames but it ignores JavaScript and Cascading Style
       Sheets.  w3m can also serve as a pager for text files named as arguments or passed on standard input, and as a general purpose directory browser.

       w3m organizes its content in buffers or tabs, allowing easy navigation between them.  With the w3m-img extension installed, w3m can display inline graphics in web pages.  And whenever  w3m's  HTML
       rendering capabilities do not meet your needs, the target URL can be handed over to a graphical browser with a single command.

       For help with runtime options, press “H” while running w3m.

ARGUMENTS
       When given one or more command line arguments, w3m will handle targets according to content type.  For web, w3m gets this information from HTTP headers; for relative or absolute file system paths,
       it relies on filenames.

       With no argument, w3m expects data from standard input and assumes “text/plain” unless another MIME type is given by the user.

       If provided with no target and no fallback target (see for instance option -v below), w3m will exit with usage information.

OPTIONS
       Command line options are introduced with a single “-” character and may take an argument.

   General options
       -B     with no other target defined, use the bookmark page for startup

       -M     monochrome display

       -no-mouse
              deactivate mouse support

       -num   display each line's number

       -N     distribute multiple command line arguments to tabs.  By default, a stack of buffers is used

       -ppc num
              width of num pixels per character.  Range of 4.0 to 32.0, default 8.0.  Larger values will make tables narrower.  (Implementation not verified)

       -ppl num
              height of num pixels per line.  Range of 4.0 to 64.0.  (Implementation not verified)

       -title, -title=TERM
              use the buffer name as terminal title string.  With specified TERM, this sets the title configuration style accordingly

       -v     with no other target defined, welcome users with a built-in page

       -W     toggle wrapping mode in searches

       -X     do not initialize/deinitialize the terminal

       +num   go to line num; only effective for num larger than the number of lines in the terminal

   Browser options
       -cols num
              with stdout as destination; HTML is rendered to lines of num characters

       -cookie, -no-cookie
              use stored cookies and accept new ones, or do neither

       -F     render frames

       -graph, -no-graph
              use or do not use graphic characters for drawing HTML table and frame borders

       -header string
              append string to the HTTP(S) request.  Expected to match the header syntax Variable: Value

       -m     Render the body of Usenet messages according to the header “Content-type”

       -no-proxy
              do not use proxy

       -post file
              use POST method to upload data defined in file.  The syntax to be used is var1=value1[&var2=value2]...

       -4     IPv4 only.  Corresponds to dns_order=4 in configuration files

       -6     IPv6 only.  Corresponds to dns_order=6 in configuration files

   Text pager options
       -l num number of lines preserved internally when receiving plain text from stdin (default 10,000)

       -r     use caret notation to display special escape characters (such as ANSI escapes or nroff-style backspaces for bold and underlined characters) instead of processing them

       -s     squeeze multiple blank lines into one

       -t num set tab width to num columns.  No effect on stdout

   Data type/encoding options
       -I charset
              user defined character encoding of input data

       -O charset
              user defined character encoding of output data

       -T type
              explicit characterization of input data by MIME type

   Options for data output, followed by immediate exit
       -dump  dump rendered page into stdout.  Set implicitly when output is directed to a file or pipe

       -dump_source
              dump the page's source code into stdout

       -dump_head
              dump response of a HEAD request for a URL into stdout

       -dump_both
              dump HEAD, and source code for a URL into stdout

       -dump_extra
              dump HEAD, source code, and extra information for a URL into stdout

       -help  show a summary of compiled-in features and command line options

       -show-option
              show all available configuration options

       -version
              show the version of w3m

   Options for overriding default settings and resources
       -bookmark file
              use file instead of the default bookmark.html file

       -config file
              use file instead of the default configuration file

       -debug DO NOT USE

       -o option=value
              modify one configuration item with an explicitly given value; without option=value, equivalent to -show-option

       -reqlog
              log headers of HTTP communication in file ~/.w3m/request.log
